# OnStepESPServer

This is the ESP8266-01 Web-Server for OnStep.  Upload this to the ESP8266-01 using the wiring as shown in numerous places on the internet.

I use the Arduino 1.6.8 IDE with the add-on for the ESP8266.  To get this setup...
Look in the Arduino Preferences menu and place this line in the additional "Boards Manager" area:
http://arduino.esp8266.com/staging/package_esp8266com_index.json
Then from the "Tools->Boards->Boards Manager" menu select the ESP8266 add-on.
Then pick "Tools->Boards->Generic 8266 Module" and upload.

Read the source code comments for help configuring!

The web-site provides a means to get OnStep up and aligned then Sky Safari and/or my OnStep ASCOM driver can take over.
